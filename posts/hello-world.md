**TL;DR:** I redesigned and rebuilt my blog with Nextjs, Tailwind, MDX with certain other tools, and served to vercel.

Had to start at some point and here is mine, lets see how this goes! My redesigned and rebuilt personal website now has a dedicated page for blog. Will utilize this space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights around tech(few maybe not) with all of you. It took long because I was continously redesigning my personal website and was never okay with the design.Taking inspiration from various portfolio sites, I have incorporated their best elements into my own design. Now that my website is live, I am delighted to showcase a variety of captivating features and functionalities. Additionally, I plan to document the process of building my personal site in an upcoming blog post, allowing others to learn from my experiences. If you're interested, please visit [prajnaprabhu.com](https://prajnaprabhu.com) to explore my newly revamped personal site.

**PS: still not completely satisfied with the design tho.**

Few blogs that I constantly check are of [Joshua Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) and [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/). They have great content around web development and nextjs.
