Had to start at some point and here is mine. Lets see how this goes. Finally have this page on my personal website. Will utilize this space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights with all of you. It took long because I was continously redesigning my personal website and was never okay with the design. Have taken inspiration from many other portfolio sites, and I have my site deployed rn. I have included a number of cool things in the site. Will write a blog on "how I built my personal site" soon in the future. If you want to check it out [prajnaprabhu.com](https://prajnaprabhu.com).

This blog is developed using nextjs, mdx, tailwindcss.
